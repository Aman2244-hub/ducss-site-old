a Python Django blog system.

```bash
python manage.py runserver 8080
```

To site is located at http://localhost:8080

Deployment
==========

Web server running python. Should really run on a solid database like MySQL in production and not on SQLite like in development. Having memcached installed and working in production is also a big plus.
